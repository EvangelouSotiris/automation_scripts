# Automation_scripts
Bash and Expect scripts that used for automation of tasks, sometimes as crontab jobs. <br>
<i> E.g. every 10 hrs log in to an FTP server and backup some specific files, can be implemented with running <b> autoftp.sh </b> every 10hrs in crontab </i>

- tested in Debian GNU/Linux 9.9 (Stretch)

# Prerequisites
- Install expect library
```
sudo apt-get install expect
```
- If a script doesn't run you might need to give execution priviledges
```
chmod +x <script_name>
```
